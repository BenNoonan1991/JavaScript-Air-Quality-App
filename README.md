# JavaScript-Air-Quality-App

An app that will display current PM2.5 pollution levels in the users location,  
and allow them to adjust an air purifier based on this information.

It can be adjusted either manually or, be set to increase or decrease its power   level based on the current pollution levels.

The initial business logic for the initial parts of the app are similar to the Thermostat challenge I completed as part of the Makers Academy course, which I have done  to refresh my JavaScript skills before moving on the the more complex parts.
